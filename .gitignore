# Quick Reference
#
# start patterns with forward slash (/) to avoid recursivity
# 	i.e. exclude /help.txt in current dir, but not in sub directories
#
# end patterns with forward slash (/) to specify a direcotry
#	i.e. doc/*.txt ignores doc/bar.txt, but not doc/foo/bar.txt
#	i.e. doc/**/*.txt ignores all .txt including in subdirectories
#
# negate a pattern by start it with an exlciation (!) 
#	i.e. excluding all .a, but including b.a by using !b.a
#
# Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use. An asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters; [abc] matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); a question mark (?) matches a single character; and brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen ([0-9]) matches any character between them (in this case 0 through 9). You can also use two asterisks to match nested directories; a/**/z would match a/z, a/b/z, a/b/c/z, and so on.
